# ImageProcessing
24 Bit C++ Image Processing program

## Possible Tasks:

1. You can begin by loading one or more files from the `\input` folder
2. Then you can perform different operations on the loaded file
3. We then write the results to a new .TGA file in the `\output` folder.  
The `\examples` folder has completed versions of what this program can do.  
It is a very primal photo editor.
